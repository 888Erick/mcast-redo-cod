            The course introduces common fundamental principles, skills and software related to contemporary fields of design. 
            Minor streams in game art, graphic design and interactive media will allow learners to specialise in their field of interest and master the required skills in preparation for more independent study at undergraduate level. 
            Exploratory exercises, real life work and the possibility of competitions all form part of the process for an effective learning experience. 
            Taught by experienced visual and technical designers from interdependent fields, this course of study prepares learners to communicate ideas and solve problems through creative and interactive solutions.
